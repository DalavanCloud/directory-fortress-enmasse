 ![Apache Fortress Rest System Architecture](images/fortress-rest-system-arch.png "Apache Fortress Rest System Architecture")

This document contains instructions to download, build, and test operations using Apache Fortress Rest component.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Table of Contents

 * SECTION 1. Prerequisites.
 * SECTION 2. Download & Build.
 * SECTION 3. Get the fortress.properties.
 * SECTION 4. Load Sample Security Policy.
 * SECTION 5. Deploy to Tomcat Server.
 * SECTION 6. Unit Test.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## SECTION 1. Prerequisites

Minimum hardware requirements:
 * 2 Cores
 * 4GB RAM

Minimum software requirements:
 * Java SDK 7++
 * git
 * Apache Maven3++
 * Apache Tomcat7++
 * Apache Fortress Core installed per README located in that same package.
 * Apache Fortress Realm installed per README located in that same package.
 * LDAP server setup and configured per Apache Fortress Core README.

Everything else covered in steps that follow.  Tested on Debian, Centos & Windows systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## SECTION 2. Download & Build

1. Build the source.
 ```
 git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/directory-fortress-enmasse.git
 cd directory-fortress-enmasse
 mvn clean install
 ```

2. Now build the javadoc:

 ```
 mvn javadoc:javadoc
 ```

 If using java 8, add this param to the pom.xml:
 ```
 <plugin>
    ...
    <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <additionalparam>-Xdoclint:none</additionalparam>
        ...
    </configuration>
 </plugin>
 ```

3. View the generated document here: [./target/site/apidocs/overview-summary.html](./target/site/apidocs/overview-summary.html).

___________________________________________________________________________________
## SECTION 3. Get the fortress.properties

Copy the fortress.properties, created during Fortress Core setup, to this package's resource folder.

```
cp [directory-fortress-core]/config/fortress.properties [directory-fortress-enmasse]/src/main/resources
```

Where [directory-fortress-core] is base folder of the fortress core source package and [directory-fortress-enmasse] is the current package's home folder.

___________________________________________________________________________________
## SECTION 4. Load Sample Security Policy

Run maven install with load file:
```
mvn install -Dload.file=./src/main/resources/FortressRestServerPolicy.xml
```

___________________________________________________________________________________
## SECTION 5. Deploy to Tomcat Server

1. If Tomcat has global security enabled you must add credentials to pom.xml:

 ```
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>tomcat-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${version.tomcat.maven.plugin}</version>
        <configuration>
            ...
          <!-- Warning the tomcat manager creds here are for deploying into a demo environment only. -->
          <username>tcmanager</username>
          <password>m@nager123</password>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
 ```

2. Get the Fortress Realm Proxy jar.

 Place the fortress-realm proxy jar, generated by the [directory-fortress-realm] package into Tomcat server's /lib folder.  The proxy jar name is named fortress-realm-proxy-[version].jar and located here: [directory-fortress-realm]/proxy/target.

3. Restart Tomcat server.

4. Enter maven command to deploy to Tomcat:
 ```
 mvn tomcat:deploy
 ```

5. To redeploy:
 ```
 mvn tomcat:redeploy
 ```

___________________________________________________________________________________
## SECTION 6. Unit Test

Run unit test:
 ```
 mvn test -Dtest=EmTest
 ```

 Test Notes:
 * The Fortress Rest application must be deployed and running within your servlet container before the unit tests will complete successfully.  If your app server
  is running on a separate machine, or using port other than 8080, adjust the settings accordingly in src/main/test/java/org/apache/directory/fortress/rest/EmTest.java
 * For learning and troubleshooting, it is recommended that you use an HTTP proxy program, like Axis' tpMon to intercept the HTTP/XML request/responses between Fortress rest client and server.
 * The tests depend on sample security policy being loaded.

___________________________________________________________________________________
## SECTION 7: Alternate testing procedures

1. Another way to test Fortress Rest is using the Fortress Core APIs which can be configured to communicate via HTTP/REST.
To enable Fortress Core test client to route requests through Fortress Rest server, add these properties to build.properties in directory-fortress-core root folder:

2. Add these credentials to build.properties file located in the directory-fortress-core root folder.  It contains the HTTP coordinates to your deployed Fortress Rest server:
 ```
 http.user=demouser4
 http.pw=password
 http.host=localhost
 http.port=8080
 ```

3. Add this to the same file.  It will override default fortress managers to route calls through REST interface:
 ```
 enable.mgr.impl.rest=true
 ```

4. Now run the directory-fortress-core mvn install to seed the new properties:
 ```
 mvn install
 ```

5. Now run the directory-fortress-core unit tests:
 ```
 mvn test -Dtest=FortressJUnitTest
 ```

 All operations should now route through Fortress Rest server.
