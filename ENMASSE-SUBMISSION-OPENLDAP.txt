Hello,

We have created a new application, called EnMasse.  

EnMasse is a web application that implements RESTful Web services to interface with
Fortress/OpenLDAP. EnMasse was built using established Open Source technologies including
Apache CXF (web services stack), Spring Framework (glue), Maven (dependencies) and JAXB (data
binding layer) and runs inside any reasonably compliant Java Servlets container. EnMasseâ€™s service
access decisions are made using declarative Java EE and Spring security policy hooks that are wired to
connect back to the Fortress RBAC component itself.
 
This product has not been published and we would like to release it as one of
the products under OpenLDAP family of products. 

What we would like from OpenLDAP foundation is the following:

1. Separate GIT project called EnMasse.
2. Mailing list for developers and users to communicate with project team.
3. Issue tracking for EnMasse project.
4. Project page for overview and how to find out more information.

I have uploaded one package, entitled enmasse-openldap-submission.zip to our FTP server that contains the source, documentation and other items for you to look at.
host: joshuatreesoftware.us
user: jtreeguest
pw: Guest123

Everything under the target folder contain generated project artifacts including deployable web archive (war) and javadoc and will not be checked into GIT.
The source is located /src folder in the package.
